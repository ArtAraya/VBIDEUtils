Software Licence / Copyright
----------------------------

Software Licence

Please read the following lines carefully, before using this software. Should you
disagree with the following, then you are not allowed to use this program. You 
MUST then delete it and never use it.

Shareware-version

You have the right to test this program for the period of one month. You are 
allowed to copy this Shareware-version (and ONLY the Shareware version) and give
it to any other person, as long as it is not modified in any way. Under modifi-
cations we understand the changing, adding or removing of any files of this 
package without the author's written permission. You are NOT allowed to pack
this program together with a commercial program or a book. Shareware dealers are
allowed to sell the Shareware version only with my explicit agreement. You are
encouraged to put this program on as many BBS systems and web site as possible.

Usage of this software after the trial period of one month is in violation of 
international Copyright law! Also it is unfair against the author, who spent
hundreds of hours writing this program.

Registration

This program is neither freeware nor public domain. A use after the 30 day trial
period requires registration. For the small registration fee see in the readme
file for further details.

Registered version

The registered version may be installed on as many computers as desired, 
as long as it is ONLY running once at a time (I.e. one installation at 
home and one at the office used by the same person). The usage by 
multiple persons at the same time (on multiple computers) requires 
additional licences.
You need a registered version on each computer used to develop your application.
You don't have any runtime fee when you sell the product using the registered
version.

Multiple licences

Additional licences allow an institution, company or school to install the
program on multiple computers or on a server. It must be guaranteed that the 
program does not run on more machines at the same time than there are licences 
purchased. All licences are issued to the same (company) name, which appears in
the program's title bar.
Additional licences allow the usage of the program at home, as long as 
the main use is at the company. 

Legal domicile is Brussels, Belgium

Liability

We try to keep our software as bug-free as possible. But it's a general rule
(Murphy), that no software ever is error free, and the number of errors increases
with the complexity of the program. That's why we cannot guarantee that this
software will run in each environment, on any Windows compatible machine, 
together with any other application, without producing errors. Any liability for
damages of any sort is hereby rejected. In any case, the liability is limited to
the registration fee.

Please test this program with non-critical data, we cannot make guarantees for
the security of your data. Should you detect errors before registration, you
accept them if you register. Any description of bugs will be accepted, but we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to correct them.
